                                Jeremy walks the walk and is relatable. He has a great attitude whether you’re looking for a drill sergeant or friendly encouragement. He provides guidance in workout, nutrition, and more based on his training certifications and personal experience. He puts together programs that are always evolving in challenge as you get stronger. He follows up and ensures that your form throughout training is proper and works to meet you where you are (injuries and all).
                                I love the variety of workouts, the support, and knowledge he provides. I’ve used him several times both virtually and in-person and I’m always happy with his coaching and the results!
                                Specifically, Jeremy began to talk with me about the importance of healthy eating and exercise. He convinced me to take back control of my weight, introducing me to daily accountability on living a much healthier lifestyle. It started out with an exercise and meal plan that worked for me and my busy work schedule. He checked on my progress weekly and was available whenever I had some rough days (sometimes I just needed someone to listen and get me back on the right track). I found that working with Jeremy gave me the encouragement and expertise I needed to believe in myself to live a much healthier life.

                                Working with Jeremy has been absolutely incredible. He personalizes everything to your benefit. If there are certain workouts that you are uncomfortable with, he will work with you to create a workout program catered to your interests. I would recommend him as a personal trainer to anyone looking for serious lifestyle changes. He responds quickly and professionally, but also gets to know you on a personal level. I’ve been on his program for a few months and have already seen major progress from his program. He will tell you exactly what’s needed on a weekly basis and it’s easy to follow. I’ve gone from a waist 36” to a 34” and lost over 15 lbs without doing too much to sacrifice my diet.

                                Jeremy has changed my life. We first worked together in San Francisco and when he moved to LA there was a void. I had extreme issues due to a childhood scoliosis fusion and because of him I went from having trouble walking to deadlifting over my weight both to his training knowledge and physical manipulation. Luckily I also found myself in La again and it was confirmed- there is no one as attentive, intelligent, and talented as Jeremy! No other trainer I found fit the bill. I immediately started feeling strong as hell once seeing him again. And he has such an enjoyable personality! I can’t recommend him enough, thank you Jeremy!!

                                Jeremy is extremely knowledgeable, and explains why a certain practice or movement is done, in addition to what it is or how to do it. His dedication to the person instead of just the client is not to be matched with a price tag. We all have different goals, expectations, and apprehensions. Jeremy takes the time to listen, and adapt to the individual’s fitness journey, as a guide that one can’t help but want to follow and learn from, more and more, each day. With that, comes tremendous results as well. I’m so grateful to have not just a trainer, but a champion.
